# Tracking community evolution with graph autoencoders
In this preliminray work, we apply deep learning on graphs for the task of clusters tracking in dynamic networks. 

## Problem definition and Motivation


Over the past two decades different techniques have been developed in order to tackle this task and different approaches were proposed based on varying assumptions on the nature of the evolution of the clusters, each with its advantages and limitations. However, in this study we adopt the method of slicing the of the evolutionary history of the graph into multiple snapshots that are called time-steps and then generating community sequences by matching clusters from different time-steps. Each sequence of matching clusters represent the life-cycle of a single evolving community. This methode is generally referred to in litterature as Independent community detection and matching [].
